            <h3>Small Website Generator - Education Edition</h3>
            <p>SereneAI's Education Edition is a locally hosted tool that teaches essential digital skills. It helps students and community members create their own personal or project webpages. Additionally, the program includes a Youth Automation Programme that teaches JSON scripting workshops. SereneAI plans to license automation tools created by students to UK businesses and pay royalties to the young creators for each active license. This creates a pathway for students to earn revenue from their creations.</p>
